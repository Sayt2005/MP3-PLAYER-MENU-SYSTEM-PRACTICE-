# MP3-PLAYER-MENU-SYSTEM-PRACTICE-
Recreated the basic management of songs in an MP3 players with a master list and user created playlists derived from existing songs in master list.
The program itself has two classes (Song, PlayList) and a Main Runner where the Menu Based System runs. 
The song class holds basic information of a song and get methods as well as comparators for ascending and descending sorts with name and id. 
The playlist class holds basic information of a playlist and get methods as well as an array list of songs that gets updated throughout the program.
The Main Runner runs the menu based system and holds four options (Song, Playlist, Sort, Exit). 
The Song section takes in 4 subsections (Add, Remove, View, Exit)
The Playlist section takes in 5 subsections (Add, Remove, Manage Playlist, View, Exit) where Manage Playlist reveals another 3 subsections (ADD, REMOVE, EXIT).
The Sort Section asks the user questions on what to sort and how.
